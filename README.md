I am currently a master student in statistics at [the University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/en).  Previously I graduated from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) where I majored in English and minored in Economics & Finance and Statistics. My research focuses on using mathematically-sound and theoretically-inspired methods to understand the internal mechanisms of Large Language Models which underly their external behaviors, primarily __in-context learning__, and control their behaviors robustly and efficiently through such understanding. In my undergraduate days I also investigated the differences between the strategies applied by pretrained language models and those suggested by traditional translation studies to improve raw machine translations of English academic texts into Chinese. I have multiple papers accepted/submitted to top-tier international conferences including NeurIPS and ICLR.

I am actively seeking productive research collaborations in the aforementioned area or other related fields. If you are interested in working together, feel free to contact me. 

<strong style="color:red;">I am seeking Ph.D. positions starting in Fall 2026.</strong>

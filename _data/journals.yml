  abstract: "Concerns over the quality of teaching in massive open online courses devoted to language learning (LMOOCs) have prompted extensive research on learning behavior in such courses. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of autonomous learning check-ins – that is, individuals sharing their own learning records and/or other information about their learning-related experience – a novel behavior that has not been studied in previous LMOOC research. Using learning analytics, we found that just 6.2% (n = 699) of a sample of 11,293 learners autonomously engaged in check-in behavior, and that the content of these learners’ check-ins varied considerably according to their contexts and the language skills they were seeking to acquire. We further found (1) a positive association between check-in behavior and LMOOC completion; (2) that students who chose to check in earned relatively low grades on unit quizzes, especially in their early stage of learning, but outperformed the non-check-in group significantly in final exam scores; and (3) that those who checked in engaged with a significantly wider array of in-LMOOC learning components than those who did not, and thus accessed a wider system of language-learning experiences. Taken together, these results confirm that check-in behavior can aid the process of learning in an LMOOC and further highlight this behavior’s wider potential to aid self-directed autonomous online learning."
